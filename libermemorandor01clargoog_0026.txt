lf our stranger looked down stream he would catch
a distant glimpse osone of the most important of the
Commons, Greencroft, of which more below; and about 150
yards below the Bridge he would see the King’s Dltch
opening into the river. This ditch, a very important
boundary ¹in the Middle Ages, as it marked the limit
of what Professor Maitland calls “the urban nucleus,’' will
be fully described below, as well as the Fields which lay
beyond it

The view up stream would be more interesting, and
even from that point would give some idea of the im-
portance of the River Cam in those days as a highway,
along which fuel and provender of all sorts were brought to
Cambridge. Close to the Bridge, on the left bank, was
probably the wharf which still exists under the name
of Fisher Lane‚ and beyond, if l am right in supposing
that the houses near the river were of insignificant size,
he might catch a glimpse of Cornhythe, otherwise Dame
Nichol's Hythe (p. 289). This must have been a specially
important wharf, for it had a lane all to itself opening out
of High Street, called afterwards King's Hall Lane, but in
earlier days the road to Darne Nichol's Hythe. The plan
shews other hythes—as for instance F laxhythe and
Salthythe—-names which indicate that each commodity had
its own whars.

From the Bridge a visitor who looked up stream would
also get a view across part of the arable ground, the
Western Fields of Cambridge lt is possible that in the
thirteenth century some portion of these F ields, that
for instance nearest to the River, had been turned into
pasture; but, before hedgerows had come into being, and
the cornfields basked in sunshine unbroken by rows of
trees, it would be possible to see from the Great Bridge
a long stretch of open land with its strips belonging
to different owners, and therefore cultivated with a
considerable variety both of produce and of method.

From the Bridge would also be visible the fish-ponds
which in those days belonged to S. John's Hospital, and
