xvi Introduction

His predecessor Robert, fifth Prior, held office fer
thirty-three years. He was therefore elected in 1175 ¹.

Hugh Domesman, fourth Prior, died ‘⁶ in the twentieth
year after he had taken office¹.'’ He was therefore elected
in 115 5.

Richard Norel, third Prior, who resigned “within two
years⁸,'’ was therefore elected in 1153.

Of the remaining two Priors we are told that Geoll'rey,
first Prior, “ ruled the church for twenty years, and after
their translation to Bamwelle died, full of years, and in
great sanctity⁴.” As the foundation took placeio 1092 we
are obliged to place Geoffrey's death in 1112, the very year
of the removal to Barnwell. Of the length of time during
which Gerard, second Prior, held office, no word is said;
and we are therefore obliged to assign to him the whole
interval between the death of Geoffrey and the election of
Richard Norel‚ namely, fortyone years. But, if a longer
time ought to be assigned to William of Devon, Prior Gerard's
time may be shortened. Before we can do that, however,
we must await further information. Until then the suc-
cession and dates of the first six Priors will be as follows:

1. Geoffrey,1092-1112.

2. Gerard, 1¹1²-1153·

3. Richard Norel, 1153-1155.

4 Hugh Domesman, 1155-1175.
5. Robore 1175-1208.

6. William of Devon‚ 1208—1213.

We will next investigate the remaining six Priors
Alter the death of William of Devon (25 May, 1213) the
office remained vacant until 23 October, when the sacrist,
William of Bedford, was elected seventh Prior¹. He died
almost immediately afterwards, and his successor, Richard
de Burgh, eighth Prior, had an equally short tenure of
officet.

The canons next elected as ninth Prior Laurence de
Stansfield who had been chaplain to his three predecessore.
