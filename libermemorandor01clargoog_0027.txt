afterwards passed to S. John's College with its other
possessions; and the fine Norman dwelling-house which
bears the absurd name of School of Pythagoras-part
of the property of the Scholars of Menon, which their
founder took the precaution of buying in case they should
prefer Cambridge to Oxford as a permanent place for
study¹.

Before we leave the Great Bridge let us consider for
a moment the very interesting question of the number
of houses which the town contained in the thirteenth
century3 and especially the number to be assigned to the
district which we have just left, and which in the
Memoranda (p. 282) is styled “Beyond Bridge (Ultra
pontem).” >

Domesday Book tells us that Grentebrige contained
400 houses divided into ten wards; that of those 400 houses
27 had been destroyed to make room for the castle3 and
that two of the ten wards had been thrown together. lt
has usually been the custom to assume that all these
houses and wards were transpontine; but this view has
been contested by Professor Maitland', who has made
a carcful analysis of the Cambridge of the Hundred Rous,
and shews thatin 1279 the whole town had only about 550
houses, of which not more than 72 were allotted to the three
transpontine parishes of S. Giles‚ S. Peter, and All Saints.
He states his view in the following brilliant passage:

l see the Grentebrige of the Confessor's day as a very sparse
group of houses. l should not be surprised if it already reached as
far south as the King's Ditclr of later days, and if only two or three of
its ten wards were transpontine. At this time a vill of 40 houses was
rather large than small Cambridge had 400. Talre the house·
bedecked nucleus of an ordinary village and magnify it ten-fold; it
will cover a good space of ground. 1 would not suggest that the
nucleus of a borough was as loosely compacted as was the nucleus of

a common vill ς but we must leave much room for what we should call
farm buildings, for orcbards and little crofts⁸.
