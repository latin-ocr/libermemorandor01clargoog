ol Barnwell seem to have been more than ordinarily caresul
in obtaining and preserving thern. A largepartos this book
consists ol such transcripta.

Let us look at one os them. We will choose rather
a long instance (μ’ 100). The maker of this book first tells
us howa certain Geofsrey of Howes held land at Madingley
