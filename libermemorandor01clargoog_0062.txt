lviii Introduction

cian monk at Vaudey. Theo, however, a certain woman,
asserting that before his profession he had eontracted
marriage with her. sued him before the ordinary and de·
raigned (dirrachnovit) him as her husband. So he is cap·
able os inheriting, and the plaintiff is therefore not next
heir. The jurors also find that the Prior is right in his
other contention, and that the* plaintiff's father held only
l'or lile. So the Prior has judgment.

Thr Prior v. Henry T uylet (pp. rso—8). Assize ol'
novel disseisin ior a house in Cambridge The alleged
disseisin consists in the tenant having blocked up a door·
way so that his landlord, the Prior, cannot enter to distrain
ferrent arrear. The jurors find a verdict for the defendant,
and he has judgment. However the Prior threatens an
‘attaint‚' and the defendant yields. The record of the
assize is given at length. An ‘attaint' was a proceeding in
which the twelve jurors might be convicted ol having swom
falsely by a verdict os twenty-four other jurors, and the
‘attainted ’ jurors would be severely punished.

T he Prior v. Jolm Humfrey ond cecilia his aorfrspp. 159
-r6o). Writ os customs and services. The extract from
¹ a roll (ᾗ 84) shows that the tenants make desault in appear·
ance and that the sherifs is directed to distrain them. We
are then told that Cecilia, who was holding the tenement in
her own right, carne with her husband into the borough
court at Cambridge ‚and released all her right to the Prior,
but as no fine was levied, there may be reason to sear that
hereaster she may renew her claim; so cantion is desirable.

T Ire Prior v. Hugh de Ros ond another (pp. 160—2)
Assize ol novel disseisin sor a rent issuing from a horse mill.
Α verdict favourable to the Prior is given, but the excerpt
from the roll does not show any judgment.

Walter otte Dolo v. The Prior (p. 162). An action lor
land in Barton: apparently an action oi 'cosinage No
record is given. The Prior being prepared to prove that
the demandant's father was hanged as a selon, the deman-
dant withdraws from his writ Descent could not be traced
through a selon. ¹
