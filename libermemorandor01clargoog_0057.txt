have in this instance the record (p. 112), the original writ
(p. 111), and a bill, scaled by the sheriff, aeknowiedging

that the original writ has been delivered to him. lt will
be noticed that our informant has leapt over some thirty

years in order that he may pursue the history of the
advowson of Burton.

T ke Prior v. Robert de Brakmberwe and Ralph de
Wyklram (pp. 112-4). Assize of darein presentment eon-

The jurors of the assiae find for the Prior, who has

Mabel widow os Thomas Τ uylrt v. The Prior (p. 118)
Action of dower. The Prior has vouched Robert son of
Robert Hubert. The sheriff has been ordered to summon
the vouchee but has not done so. The order is repeated.
We leam no more.

T he Prior v. John de Burdrlay (pp. 118—9). Writ for
admeasurement of pasture in Madingley. We have the
