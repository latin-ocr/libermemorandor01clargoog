Exchequer ol the Jews with a de'bt due by Roger Giffard.
The Prior seems to have acquired some lands which are
burdened with this debt, and the debt—as osten happens
with debts originally owed to Jews-has become due to the
King. The Prior is allowed to pay by instalments and
finally goes quit. The list os Giffard's tenants, which is
given in 5 ς 5, might in some way or another serve to
identiiy the lands that were burdened.

Peter de Clravent v. The Prior (pp. 138-9). Action ol
replevin removed by pone into the Bench. The verdict and
judgment seem to be taken from the record ; but the plead-

mirabiliter bene pro Priore!

Isabella carvin v. The Prior (p. 142). Writ ol right lor
land in Bourne. Alter the Prior has put himself upon a
grand assiae, the demandant makes delault. The Prior
insists upon the delault (capit se prtem ad predictam
defaltum) and judgment is given in his lavour. This is an
