ceedings Itis lou'nd that John bad on the moor twenty
beasts in excess ot' his proper allowance.

At this point (p. 119) our good canon leaves his records
lor a while in order that he may tell a story about the
acquisition ol some land at Wiggenhall in Norfollr‚ and
thence he digresses to the Barons’ War, the occupation ol
ot' the lsle oi Ely by the disinherited, King Henry's visit to
Cambridge, and so forth. But all this national history
seems to be parenthetic, and, so soon as the land is at peace,
we recur to Wiggenhall and observe the ill that besell John
the Chaplain who endeavoured to cheat the Prior. We
read ot' proceedings in the ecclesiastical murts, but none ol
the documents are transcribed. Ultimately John, as a
contumacious excommunicate, is arrested and imprisoned‚
having been dragged by his ieet lrom out the Franciscan's
chureh in Cambridge. Then a little more narrative carries
us on to the eyre held at Cambridge in 1272. This gives
occasion lor some briei notes os actions and final concords.
These we may pass by. Also we may pass by the incipient
dispute between the Canons and the Burgesses about the
right to drive cattle along the river bank from Midsummer

Common to Stourbridge Common (p. 133). That dispute ’

led to violent deeds during the Peasants' Rebellion in 13811.
We look ior something more deserving of technical com·

the Master brought a writ oi right, counting on a seisin in
the time ol' Henry Il, and that because the seisin was laid
before the time ol limitation (the coronation oi Richard 1),
final judgment was given for the Prior. This plea prevails,
and once more a final judgment is given sor the Prior.
All this matter appears to be copied from the record.

The exact point os the next two sections (ᾖ 5 5-6) is
not very plain. Apparently the Prior is charged at the
