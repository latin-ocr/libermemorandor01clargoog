clustered round it¹.” Ad joining the Market Place our visitor
would see the church ol S. Mary the Great, with houses
built up against it, and no open space in lront ol it; but it
must be remembered that that church was very different in
the thirteenth century lrorn the stately building ol the
present day, which was not begun till near the end os the
fifteenth century.

To leave the Market Place our visitor could choose
between Shoernaker Row, now Market Street, and Petty
Cury, which keeps its curious old name, over the‚meaning
os which so much discussion has arisen. In the period
which 1 arn trying to describe it must have been a singularly
picturesque street, lull os movement, lor on the south side ol
it there were at least three well-known inns‚ the Lion‚ the
F alcon, and the Wrestlers; to take the order in which they
would be approached from the Market Place. At the end
ol Petty Cury our visitor would find himself at the south·
east corner os the town; and, il he turned slightly to the
right, as sar as Barnwell Gate, then probably a·real gate, he
would catch a glirnpse os the cultivated helds stretching
away as iar as the eye could see; and in the ioreground the
parish church ol S. Andrew, with the Dominican Friary
beyond.. From this point he would turn to the left, and
wall< up Bridge Street. Passing on the leit Trinity Church,
then a very small building, he would soon reach the
Franciscan House at the corner ol S. Rhadegund's Lane
Turning into this lane, and crossing the bridge over the
King²s Ditch‚ he would see on his lelt the boundary walls
ol the nunnery ol S. Rhadegund founded 1133. Alter
passing this, as he pursued his way to Barnwell Priory, he
would have on his lest the Green croit, an open space
os pastum, on part of which, nearest to the causeway, the
Fair called Midsumnrer Fair was held (p. 87 note), and on
his right Bradmoor Field‚ part ol the arable held. At the
Priory, round which there was a small suburb, he would
hnd that the Canons did not lorget to entertain strangers².
