xliv Introduction

defensive weapons. lt is characterized by the unusually
large number of ‘ records ’ (that word being used in a specific
sense) which it contains. But still our scribe is not com-
posing a cartulary, or a mere collection of those entries upon
judicial rolls which relate the law-suits of his house He
adopts a narrative form. He will tell us briefly the story
of the priory, laying stress on litigation and introducing the
very words of those formal enrolments to which reference
should be made hereafter if anyone is rash enough to call
in question the rights of St Giles of Barnwell We must
add, however, that when he comes down to his own time he
begins to sprinkle his story with anecdotos which he tells in
a spirited and humorous way. These will to modern eyes
be the most attractive portion of his work. Nevertheless,
if we look at them closely we shall see that as a general
rule these little tales are put in writing for the same reason
that has dictated the transcription of the legal ‘records'
They are meant to be instructive They are meant to
suggest what should be done hereafter is litigation is
imminent; but happily the writer sometimes, if 1 may so
say, ‘sees the fun of the thing’ and gives us in miniature
some pictures of men and manners for which we ought
to be grateful.

We have thus a very curious mixture. We have
‘records' that are set forth in the highly formal and
technical language of the lawyers of the thirteenth century,
and then we have anecdotes which are told in an unusually
colloquial kind of Latin. The second of these two elements
in the compound will be easily understood by all who have ,
pald any attention to English modieval history. Of the
first I have been asked by my friend Mr Clark to say a few
words.

The ‘records' of which 1 speak are transcripts of entries
made upon judicial rolls: upon the rolls of the central
courts at Westminster; upon rolls of the justices who are
commissioned to hear those actions that are known as
‘assizes’; and upon the rolls of the justices in eyre. Such

transcripts from judicial rolls are occasionally to be found
