xxiv Introduction

Orchards and little crofts Professor Maitland might
have added gardens to this enumeration; sor a glance at

the plans ol college sites given in The Architectura!
History will shew how many gardens there were in what we
should now call the centre ol the town; and a similar
result will be attained by a study ol the large birds-eye
view ol Cambridge made by John Hamond‚ and dated
1592. ll there were still large tracts of garden·ground at
that date, nearly 300 years aiter the period we are now
considering, a sartrbri there were such in 1279.

We will now suppose our visitor to leave the Great
Bridge, and to walk down Bridge Street. This street
was probably as crowded in the Middle Ages as at present,
perhaps more so. The town of that day drawing its
supplies from the river, as l have already pointed out, and
also from the neighbouring country, would be fullos carts
and pack horses. When Loggan's views were drawn this
was still the case; but in the thirteenth century, when the
townspeople were confined within the oval space between
the river and the King's Ditch‚ the unpaved streets (p. 227)
must have been filled to overflowing with carriages, cans,
horses, waylarers, struggling as best they could through the
mud and dirt, for scavengers did not exist in those days.
Our stranger would presently pass, on his lest, the Church
ol S. Clement, with, probably, not many houses on each side
ol it On his right the houses would be more numerous,
because more convenient. Behind them was the river-
the highway—to which each could have private access.
When he reached the Norrnan Church of S. Sepulchre,
or Round Church, where two streets meet, he would
naturally turn down High Street‚ lor il he selected the
other, he would soon reach the outskirts os the town, close
to the present Post Office.

On his lest, as he turned into Higb Street, was the
Jewry‚ osten alluded to in the Memoranda. l do not know
how sarit extended, but the church of All Saints there
situated‚ is always called Ecclesia Omnium Sanctarum in
J adarama, or, All Halowes in thesewry, to distinguish it from
