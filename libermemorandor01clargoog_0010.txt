whole work in its complete form, for he was keenly in-
terested in it, not merely for the legal cases, but even more
for the minute records in the Sixth and Seventh Books,
where the villages in Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire
(in part) are enumerated, with the 'duties which each holder ’
of land was bound to perform, and the payments he was
bound to make.

In the next place 1 wish to retum my very cordial thanks
to my friend, W. J. Corbett‚ M.A.,1²enow of King's College,
who supplied me with the English names oi the places
mentioned in the Sixth Book, and also corrected the Index,
and gave me much assistance in drawing up the Glossary.
1 was anxious to make this latter as full as possible,
especially in legal terms, the significance os which can only
be properly expressed by one who is both an antiquary and
a lawyer-a combination which 1 have had the good fortune
to discover in Mr Corbett Further, before l leave the
Glossary, 1 wish to thank Professor Skeat for assistance
for which Ι cannot be sufficiently grateful.

Ι have also to thani< G. J. Tumer, Esq, Barrister at law,
for many references to the Rolls of Assize and other public
documents; Arthur Gray, MA, Fellow and Tutor of Jesus
College, for information respecting the River Cam and the
Castle; M. R. James, titel), Provost of King’s College,
and C. E. Sayle, MA, of St John’s College, for help and

“ encouragement on many occasions.
