is given us, and the¹ verdict of an inquestss 111), and we
are told that judgment went against the Prior. Apparently
the Prior based his claim to immunity on the mere fact
that he had not contributed in the past; but we soe no
pleadings. Less than we might wish has yet been done to
make available for modern students the valuable materiais
that are contained on the plea rolls of the Exchequer.
The story that lies before us is typica} of a great mass of ·
quarrels over the incidence of local imposts

The Prior v. William sorr of Robcrt and others (p. 179).
The men of Madingley‚ bent on distraining the Prior for
his contribution, made the mistake of taking his beasts of
the plough. Consequently he brings against them the
action given by the Statute de Districtione Scaccarii
(51 Hen. 111). The ‘original' writ which refers to this
Statute, is given, but no extract from any record. The
men of Madingley made their peace with the Prior.

' T lre Prior v. Thomas de Bellrus, Shen'ffff Cambridgeshire
(pp. 180-2). Action of trespass vi et armis for releasing
a prisoner from the Prior’s custody and exacting a ransom
from the Prior. The writ to the sheriff ordering him to
restore the extorted money (ᾖ 114) is preserved3 also the
‘original' writ (ᾖ 115) which, as the sheriff is defendant, is
addressed to the coroners. This is an action in the
King's Bench, as is shown by the words ‘coram nobis
ubicunque fuerimus in Anglia‚’ which occur instead of
‘coram iusticiariis nostris apud westmonasterium,' the style
of the Common Bench. We hear of pleading, but only
know that after ‘a love-day had been taken: peace was
made on the mediation of one of the justices.

T he Prior v. Ralph of Leicestrr and tlte Chancdlor of the
Universa& (pp. 182-4). Assize of novel disseisin. The
parties plead to issue. Α11 order is given that the assize be
taken (iiico capiatur assisa), but before the recognitors come
to give a verdict‚ the parties make peace. The record is
set forth at length. The dispute arises out of the strange
right of the UnIversity to compel the towns-foik to let

lodgings ata taxed rate. A verdict about this matter
