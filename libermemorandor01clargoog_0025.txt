the stone cross which was on the eastern side os the
Huntingdon Road opposite the point where it is joined by
the road now known as Pleasant Row, anciently Hare
Hi11.”

Mr Gray then discusses the position of the other points
mentioned in the above passage, but, as I have determined
to avoid details as sar as 'possible in this Introduction,
I will merely say that, aiter pointing out that the jurors‚
being local men, could not have made a mistalre in pure
ignorante, he argues that the vetus fossatum which crossed

Bridge Street opposite to the site now occupied by ’

Magdalene College, was once a navigable stream, and
in support of this view he cites a further passage from the
Memoranda (p. 99) giving the evidence oi a very aged
palmer-pilgrim “who said that he had seen ships (naves)
come almost up to the door oi S. Giles’ church.'’

On leaving the castle and descending the hill our visitor
would see on his right the little church of S. Peter, and on
his left, in the angle between the road along which he was
walking, and a track which led eastwards to Chesterton,
the somewhat larger church of S. Giles. This is the
church built by Pycot and his wife in 1092, adjoining which
was the first house ior their Canons (pp. 39, 46) in which
they resided until Pain Peverel gave them “thirteen acres
in the fields of Cambridge round the springs ol Barnwell'’
(p. 43). The ground between this church and the river
was claimed by the Prior in 1286 as the giit of Countess
Matilda to his convent (p. 168).

From this point where tour ways meet—the Carfax
of Cambridge-a very short space os street leads down to
the river at the point where the Great Bridge now stands.
ln the thirteenth century the ancient sord had been
replaced by a bridge, of course ol wood; and in 1279 the
commissioners oi Edward I found that it was “so broken
and dislocated that the carriages ol noble persons and
others sall into the water in such a way that both men and
horses come to the suriace with difficulty¹.”
