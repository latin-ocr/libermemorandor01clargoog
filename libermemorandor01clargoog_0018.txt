xiv Introduction

Before 1 pass to other matters 1 should like to say a
lew words on the author ol the Memoranda. He gives no
hint as to who he was, but it is obvious that he must have
been at least a canon ol the House, and probably one who
held some high office, lor in no other way could he have
had access to the documents and private matters with
which he deals. lt is probable that he based his work
on that ol a previous historian3 lor, when he is telling the
story ol Prior Domesman's generosity in giving his lather’s
land to the House (p. 98), he says: “so wrote Canon
Guarinus,'’ but he evidently has doubts about his accuracy,
for he adds: “l do not remember to have seen the deed ol
gist.’¹ That he examined originals is obvious from the
way in which he notes minute particulars-as the colour
ol the wax ol which a Royal Seal was made, and its
condition. He may have been a student in the
neighbouring University‚ for he was evidently a learned
person, who wrote a good style, and was well acquainted
with classical Latin. Whoever he was, the epitheta which
he applies to Prior Gerard (p. 64), when he calls him
pleasant, and very good humoured (Jiuondm et hyllanir
valde), might have been applied with justice to himself.
There is, ol course, what l may call a professional tone
about a good deal ol his narrative ; the world is very evil ;
the monastic orders are the objects ol a cruel persecution;
the hand ol every man is against them: and almost any
weapon may justifiably be used by them to combat their
enemies. But, when allowance has been made lor the
introduction of these unavoidable phrases, how even is
the how ol his narrative; how admirably he describes
an event; what humorous touches he introduces when
occasion allows ol it. ln support ol what 1 have said let
me cite his description ol the burning ol the church-tower

(p. 220) ; his account ol what belell at Wiggenhall when
Prior Jolan and some ol his canons were set upon by
thieves, and barely escaped with their lives (pp. 119-121) ;
the evident amusement with which he tells the story ol the
worn-out horse sent as a present to a great man (p. 126) ;
