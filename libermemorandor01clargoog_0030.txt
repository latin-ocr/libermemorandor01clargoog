small bridge‚ and thence by a larger bridge into the fields
beyond. Here was Henny or Heneye (p. 289) a mysterious
name which 1 cannot explain ; but the locality was thought
important enough to have alane all to itself. Milne Street,
which we will suppose our stranger to follow, led, as its
name irnports, to the Mills‚ namely the Kings’ Mill and the
Bishop’s Mill on Coe Fen. It must therefore have been
a busy, and at times acrowded, thoroughfare. It contained
the church of S. John Baptist. often mentioned in the
Memoranda, and the House of the Carmelites (p. 211).
Between the church and the friary were three lanes, Water
Lane, Salthithe Lane or Strawey Lane (pp. 284, 289), and
lastly Cholles Lane(p. 289), which, by the help of S. Austin's
Lane and Bene’t Street, furnished direct access from the
water's edge to Peas H ill and the Market Place. The south

space were named after the wares sold in them, as oat-

S. Edward’s chureh, which is described in the Memoranda
(p. 287) as situated in it. ln thosedays Peas Hill
was connected with the Market Place proper by a short
street, the west side of which consisted of houses abutting
against the east end of S. Edward's Church. The Market
Place proper, an L-shaped area, “contained all the principal
buildings, the Cross, the Tolbooth or Guildhall, the prison,
the fountain, and also the stocks and the pillory. The
principal inns looked on to it, or were close to it, and the
old names of the streets shew that the principal trades
