1. Grithow (Gravel Hill) F ield, lay between the roads
to Huntingdon and St Neots,

2. Middle Field lay next to this, on the south side os ,

the road to St Neots‚ extending as far as Bin Brook.

3. Little Field lay next to this, extending as sar as
the road to St Neots‚ but separated from Middle Field by
a lootpath known as the Barton way, which led across the
fields to the village of Barton. Portfield seems to have
been part of Little Field ¹.

- 4 Carme Field, the most southern os the sour, took its
name from a block ol twenty selions in Newnham, known
in the sourteenth century as the Carmedole’.

Professor Maitland points out that “there was little
meadow in medieval Cambridge‚” and quotes William
Harrison‚ writing in 1577, who says:

lt bath no such store ol medowe grounde as may suffice sor the
ordinarie expences οἱ the towne and Vniuersitie, whereiore they are
insorced...to provide their haye from other villages about, which
rninister the same uoto thern in verye great abundance⁸.

There was Long Green, which lay along the left bank
ol the Cam, from the Mill Pool to the Great Bridge3
Sheeps Green; Coe Fen, or part os it; and Green Croft.
Between these two latter were Swine Crost, Parkers Piece,
and Christ's Piece, but these were late additions. Parker's
Piece, lor instance, was not turned ‘from tillage into sward'
until aster it was acquired by the town srorn Trinity College
in 1613.
