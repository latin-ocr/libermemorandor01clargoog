what that name might imply,' but that it was originally a
nic-kname, well or ill deserved‚ we can hardly doubt
The modern English form oi the name would probably be
Pcaclrey. ¹

The next record that we meet with comes from the
rolls oi justices in eyre who visited Cambridge in ¹²99
(p. 63)¹. The Prior is to answer to the King quo waranto
he claims certain ‘franchises ¹-that is, royal rights-to wit,
view ol srankpledge and the amends ior breaches os the
assize of bread and beer in Chesterton and an annual fair
in Barnwell. He escapes easily, producing royal charters
He is toldthat he may ‘go without day '-that is, he need
not come into Court again. But, as is usual in such cases,
there is a salvo sor the King's right: in other words, the
King will not de estopped by this record srorn hereaiter
urging any right that he may have to recover these
franchises.

When he is compiling his Second Book the writer looks
outside the ‘ domus,' but thinks primarily os property that
lies close at hand. Specially he has to speak os Chesterton.
Now Chesterton was part os the ancient dernesne ol the
Crown. We begin with an extract froin Domesday Book
which describes it as dominica villa Regis (p. 75). This
handsome manor passed into the hands os the Prior and
Canons. King John had granted them an annuity ol ten
pounds by way oi alms. Then, instead os the annuity‚ he
granted them the vill os Chesterton sor ever, reserving a
rent of {30 oi blanched money, which are equivalent to

A 31 by tale. Confirmations were obtained irorn Henry 111
and Edward Ι.

The King had a right to impose upon the manors os
his ancient demesne the kind of tax that was known as a
tallage. Il he allowed one of those manors to go out ol
his own hand by putting a mesne lord over it, normally he
lost his right. Thencesorth it was sor that iord to impose
ior his own profita tallage on that rnanor when the King
was tallaging the manors that were still in his own hand.
