fii Introduction

There is no law-suit here. We have an inquest taken

ex officw for the ascertainment of royal rights.

T lte Prior v. Richord dc Capella and Τ he Prior v. ο
Humplzrey de Cloptone and others (pp. roo-8) Two assizes
of novel disseisin. The first is taken upon the default of

the defendant; the jurors find a disseisin and the Prior
recovers. fn the second the defendants confess the dis·
seisin and the Prior recovers. In addition to the record

of these two assues, we have the two original writs and
also the ‘patent of assize’ appointing justices to take
these two assiaes. The record begins with the formula,
Assysa uenit recognitum (p. 107).

William (pp. 108-110). Assize of darein presentment
conceming the church of Burton. The plaintiff says that
the fast parson was presented by his great-great·grand·
mother. The Prior says that a predecessor of his was
the presentor. Otho says that his grandmother was the
presentor. The jurors of the assize fmd for the Prior. He
has judgment and a writ to the bishop. All this matter

seems to be transcribed from the record. Then a writ is
also transcribed; it is the distringas iuratores (p. 110),

This assize, like other assizes of darein presentment, is
taken before the Bench at Westminster, and not before
justices of assiae.

ft next appears that, despite this victory in a purely
possessory action, the Prior and his presentee had to make
peace with Ralph de Camoys and his wife, promising them
twenty marks in return for a release of any right they
might have in the advowson. This transaction was effected
before justices in eyre at Lincoln. The account of it
(pp. 110—1) seems to come from the roffs of those
