xxviii Introduction

Vq Tne Kruo’s Dncn.

The plan of Cambridge shews the course of the ditch
called the King's Ditch¹, which marks the limit of “the
urban nucleus '' on the south-east, east, and north-east sides.
This' ditch was begun by King John in 1215¹3 and
continued and developed, with the addition of two gates,
called respectively Trumpington Gate and Barnwell Gate
(see plan), by King Henry the Third in 1267, when the
men of the lsle of Ely were making themselves specially
disagreeable. The author of the Memoranda dwells upon
the King's eagerness to get the work done, and tells us that
“He had gates made, and. ditches dug round the town with
much (siligenes, nor would he allow the labourers to rest
from their work on holydays'' (p. 122). The use of the
plural “ditches ” is worth noting, with regard to the
evidence for more ditches than one which Professor Hughes
obtained near Trumpington Gate in 1893. Whatever may
be the correct view on this difficolt question, it is clear that

¹in 1279, when the Hundred Rolls were written, the ditches
for official purposes, were regarded as one, and further, that
there was an open space, a sort of boulevard, beside the
ditch, and evidently within it, as otherwise the houses
of the burghers could not have opened upon it, as the ’
following extract shows that they did.

They [the jury] say that our lord the King-that is to say lord
Henry, father of Edward now king, during the time of disturbance in
England, caused a certain ditch' to be made whicb goes round the
town of Cambridge on one side, together with 3 certain circuit
belonging to the said ditch, which ditcb and circuit remain waste,
and bring profit to nobody, to the great danger and loss of all persons
who bave their dwellings (mrim) abutting on the aforesaid circuit.
They say, however, that Richard Laurence bas planted opposite to his

house certain trees close to (subtus) the ditch of our lord the King,
for the keeping up and improvement of the aforesaid ditch3 but that

Hughes, who has made the subject peculiarly his own, should be consultedr
