He died, an old man, “111 the thirty-eighth year os his
office¹.’' His death may therefore be placed in 1251.
Henry ol Eye, tenth Prior, “in his third year of office
placed his resignation in the hands ol' the official ol the see
of Canterbury, during a vacancy os the see of Ely¹.'' The
vacancy here mentioned must be that‘ which occurred alter

the death ol Hugh Northwold,6 August, 1254, whose

successor, William of Kilkenny, though elected, according
to Bentham‚ “about the middle ol October, 12 54⁸,'' was not
consecrated until 15 August, 1255. The see was therefore
without a Bishop lor a full year, and the Prior's resignation
may have taken place either at the end os 1254 01 the
beginning os 12 5 5.

The successor to Henry ol Eye, Jolan of Thorley,
eleventh Prior, “ in the eleventh year os his tenure of office
as Prior, resigned it into the hands of the Bishop ol Ely⁴.''
Accordingly he was Prior 110111 1254 or 1255 to 1265 01
1266; and our chronology would be persectly simple is we
had no other evidence than this to deal with. But, among
the vexations which ruined his health was the outrage at
Wiggenhall; and the rubric os the chapter in which that
event is recorded (p. 119) runs as follows: De predacione
de Wygmlrale anno regni regis H. ,lrj0.; that is to say it
is placed between 28 October, 1267, and 27 October, 1268,
01 a year too late.

¹ Further, his successor Simon de Ascellis, who ought
perhaps to be called Simon of Ashley, twell'th Prior,
resigned 24 June, 1297⁸, having been Prior “for thirty years
and more (per traginta annos et amplius),” a length ol' office
which places his accession in 1267, 01 111 1266, according to
the sense we assign to the words etamplius. 1 am inclined
to think that the simplest way out ol' the difficulty is to
suppose that a wrong date has been inserted into the rubric
quoted above3 and that for ,lij0 we should read ‚lj‘.-an
