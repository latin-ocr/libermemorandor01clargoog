which well deserves careful study.

At the close ol' the itineration ol the Justices there came many
king's briels ot' (bro warranto. For, two years previously, the king, by
advice oi John de Kirkeby, had begun Cambridge Castle Whereol, by
· the kings precept inquisition was made by free lieges os the county
concerning the Castle bounds, who, having been swom, made a peram·
bulation os it. Beginning at the place called Amswern they went
round the fossatum os the Castle, ascending as sar as the place called
Asrvykston, and then descending they passed through the middle oi
the curia oi the scholars oi Merton through the old fossatum astar
as the river. And at last retuming they gave answer on their oath that
all this circuit belonged to the Castle bounds. On this occasion came
king's brieis ol Quo warranto addressed severally to all who dwelt
beyond the bridge in the Castle quarter. This caused universal alarm.

Mr Gray suggests that Armeswerk was probably “a
barbican on the river bank, protecting the river lront oi the
castle and the bridge from assault ol an enemy proceeding
up stream ¹'; and he has pointed out to me that the same
word is used in the Chronicle oi the monastery at Ely called
Liber Elr'ensis to designate the spot at which the messengers
sent by Sexburga found a marble sarcophagus fit to contain

. the body oi her sister Etheldreda:

They came to a small town, then in ruins, at no great distance
[lrom Ely]‚ called in English Grantecester. And while they were
walking to and iro in much tribulatioo, they found, at a place which
even to the present day is called Armeswerch, a sarcophagus ol white
marble, etc.¹

Mr Gray further shews, on the evidence of a terrier
among the muniments oi Jesus College which was originally
drawn up in the reign ol' Edward the Third, the position ol
Aswykston :

Ashwylre stone ys by γε hie erosse at ye Castle end, south weste ot
ye stone crosse, as it were a quayste cast οἱ, hentingedon waye
betwixt, and is nove a hill, and once stood yar on a lyttle stomped
crosse

“A quoit throw,'' adds Mr Gray, “is usually considered
to be 19 yards. Aswylrston stood at this distance S.W. ol
