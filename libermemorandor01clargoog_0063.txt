, Walter son of Ralplr le Lord v. Tlre Prior (pp. 163—5).
Writ of wardship. The demandant claims the wardship of
a moiety of certain tenements in Barton on the ground that
the late tenant of the tenements held of the demandant by
military service. The Prior pleads that he is holding the
moiety as the right of his church and therefore need not
answer to a writ of wardship. The demandant replies
and the Prior rejoins, and judgment is given for the Prior
as upon ademurrer. The facts which occasioned this
dispute are very curious; but they are clearly stated by
the narrator and must not be suffered to delay us.

The Prior v. Wan'n de L’Isle (pp. 165-6). Writ ¹of
customs and services. No record is given. We are told
however that by way of defence Warin produced a spurious
charter. Thereupon the Prior was advised to claim the
land in demesne, and the tenant hastened to make his
peace

Some further accounts of litigation-not records-bring
us to the end of what happened in the Cambridge cyre of
1286 (pp. 166—71). The memorialist is not a little
triumphant over the Prior’s many successes, but is exceed·
ingly frank in telling us how the favour of the justices and
of their clerks was secured by generous hospitality.

We corne next to a very interesting tale of prolonged
litigation in the Courts Christian between the Prior and the
Vicar of Guilden Morden (pp. 171-6) lt shows us a
seamy side of ecclesiastical affairs. However, the documents
which were indited in the course of this obstinate struggle
are not transcribed. Probably they would have filled a
large book. . ’

There follows a suit in an ecclesiastical court, before the

official of the Bishop of Norwich for a legacy bequeathed
to the Priory by Eva Pecche (p. 176). ’

T he Men of Madinglcy v. The Prior (pp. 177-9). Suit
in the Exchequer to compel the Prior as a landowner at
Madingley to contribute to the common amercements
imposed upon that vill. A vill is frequently amerced as a
unit for neglect of police duties. The original writ (5 110)
