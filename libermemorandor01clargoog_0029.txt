its fellow near the castle. The quarter of which the Jewry
formed a part was of considerable extent, and in form
roughly triangular. The two sides were formed by Bridge
Street and High Street respectively, and the base by
Shoemaker Row-now Market Street Another chumh,
that of S. Michael, stood near its southwest comer; but,
with the exception of this church and that of All Saints
previously recorded, it was made up of dwelling-houses and
their gardens. Many centuries were to elapse before it was
crossed by any thoroughfare. When Hamond's plan was
drawn (1592) there was a passage leading into the church-
yard of All Saints from the east, but that was all.

On the opposite or west side of High Street were
a number of side-streets‚ all leading down to the river, and
shewing, by their frequency‚ how important it was to obtain
access to it at various points. These lanes, for they hardly
deserve a better name, succeeded each other from north to
south in the following order: S. John's Lane, on the north
border of the Hospital of S. John, founded in or about 1135

Lane; Piron Lane; S. Austin’s Lane; and Plutes Lane

still exists‚ and is probably as narrow now as it was in the
thirteenth century. He would presently see, on his right,
a muddy lane graphically called Le Foule Lane, which at
that period was unimportant‚ but a quarter of a century
later was to contain Michael House‚ and soon afterwards to
give access to Kings Hall. This Lane would offer no
attractions; and he would either pass on to Flaxhythe‚
situated, not on the river, buton a branch of it which
bounded the island called Garret Hostel Green on the
east—or follow S. Michael’s Lane, which soon turned at
right angles to its former course, and became Milne Street
On his right was Garret Hostel Lane, by pursuing which
he could pass first on to the Green of the same name bya
