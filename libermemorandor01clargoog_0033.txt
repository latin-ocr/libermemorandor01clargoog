And the aforesaid Richard has made a certain drawbridge over the
aforesaid ditch that he may have exit and entrance with his floclrs and
cattle into the common pasture of Grenecroft such as the aforesaid
Richard and his forefathers were accustomed to have in time of peace
from a time that none can remember. .

Moreover they say that Thomas de Clopton has appropriated to
himself out of the circuit belonging to the ditch of our lord the King a
certain parcel of ground adjoining the ditch at the end of his dwelling,

50 feet in length, and in breadth 8 feet between the erest (crottam) of
the ditch and his dwelling

Moreover Stephen the Chaplain has appropriated to himself a
parcel of ground lying near the ditch at the end of his dwelling 36
feet long, and 8 feet broad between the crest of the ditch and his
dwelling¹.

The direction of the ditch is indicated on the plan with
sufficient clearness to render any description of its course
needless. It is evident‚ from the language used by our
author, that it was intended by its means to provide
an efficient protection for the town against the freebooters
of the lsle of Ely (insulares). It was therefore conducted
along such a course that all the more important buildings
were within its circuit. It must not, however, be assumed
that there were nothing left outside it. The roads which
lead out of walled towns are nearly always bordered with
houses, and Cambridge offered no exception to this rule.
Beyond Trumpington Gate we find the parish church of
S. Peter (now S. Mary the Less), which was obviously left

the ditch start below the milis than above them. On the
site of Peterhouse there were several messuages, and the
House of the Brethren of the Sack (p. 218); and the site
of Pembroke Hall opposite was also occupied by a row of
dwelling houses next the street, with gardens behind them.
The parish church of S. Andrew, next Barnwell Gale, was
also left outside the circuit, probably for some practica}
