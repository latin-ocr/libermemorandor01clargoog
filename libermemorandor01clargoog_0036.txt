xxxii Introduction

The eastern fields, commonly known as the Bamwell
Fields, were four in number, and, counting from the south
west, appear in the following order (see plan)¹:

1. Ford Field, so called from the ford by which the
London Road entered the territory of Cambridge, lay
between the Trumpington Road and the Hills Road, but
was bounded on the townward side by what is now

Lensfield Road.

2. Middle Field lay between the Hills Road and the
line of the Mill Road, but was bounded on the townward
side by what is now Parker’s Piece.

3. Bradmore or Bradmoor F ield‚ called also Meledlch,
lay between the Mill Road and the Newmarket Road; but
the townward part of it was known as the Clayangles
or Clayhanger.

4 Sturbridge Field, anciently called Estenhale, lay on
both sides of the Newmarket Road just beyond Barnwcll
Priory.

Professor Maitland has obtained evidence which makes
it clear that in Ford F ield the site of Peterhousc and the
tract subsequently called Swine Croft or St Thomas' lcys
were once arable; that in Middle F ield, Parker's Piece was
arable; and that in Bradmoor Field, Christ's Piece also
was arablc. The tract therefore which extended from Coe
Fen to the Newmarlret Road was in very ancient times one
large cornheld. Subsequently part of these fields was
laid down as grass, and then the word ‘ley' instead of the
word ‘selion ' was used with reference to them. Some of
the old selions may be detected to this day in the grounds
of Downing Colleget

On the west side of Cambridge there were also four
fields, but, as our Memoranda do not busy themselves with
them, Ι need not do more than mention them in asummary

fashion.
