more ancient due known as ‘ward penny' (pp. 238—272h
This is succeeded by a statement of what was due lor “view
ol lrankpledge” lrom the vills in the various hundreds
(pp. 273—279); and this again by the amount of Sherill's
aid payable in each hundred (p. 280) The reason lor this
enumeration is set forth in the prologue to the Sixth Book,
which is worth translating (p. 238):

ln several hundreds the Prior ol Barnwell has lands and tenements,
services and homages, customs and villeins3 but, as the servants ol the
Sherifl osten distrain ol their own accord and unjustly, distrainlog
some whom they ought to pass over, and sparing others who ought ol
right to be distrained‚ in order to prevent the Prior or his tenants
being in the future oppressed unjustly by distraints ol this kind lor
suits in the courts ol the county or the hundred, Sheriti’s aid or ward·
penny, it seemed uselul to write down in this little work the names ol
the hundreds, the tenants, and the tenements which ought to perform
services ol this sort, and have been in the habit ol perlormlng them
from ancient days And in lutore it will not be a man’s duty on
account ol such distraint to go to the Castle to inspect the Sherifl’s
roll, hut he may look into this book aud gain his informatiom lrorn it.

ln the Seventh Book we return to the Prior and
Conventus Barnwell, and we find that it contains a lull
list ol all their tenants Here again l will translate a
short passage lrom the prologue (p. 282):

As the Prior of Barnwell has some lree tenants and some villeins,
who owe hlrn services and customs, lt appears uselul to set down ln
this little book the sames ol all his tenants, their rents, their services,
the vill in which they live, their laws, and the places where they can
be distrained, according to what certain information can bediscovered
about these matters at this time, namely, in the year ol our Lord 1295,
and in the year since Simon de Ascellis became Prior the thirty
first.

The Eighth Book is wholly occupied witha Comae·
minoritam, or Book ol Observances, ol the Aughstinian
Order. As this' book has been already edited‚ with a
translation and notes, by the editor ol this work¹, it has
been decided not to reprint it.
