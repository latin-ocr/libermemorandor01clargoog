1 will suppose a stranger to approach Cambridge from
the north-west, along the Huntingdon Road. After passing
the village of Girton, then called Gretton‚ he would soon
reach the hamlet of Howes or le Howes (pp. 282, 283), the
name of which still su'rvives in Howe House. On getting
close to Cambridge the first object he would see would be
the stone cross at Castle End, and near it, on his right, the
parish church of All Saints, called All Saints by the
Castle, to distinguish it from All Saints in the Jewry. lt
stood in an extensive churchyard, and must have been
almost, if not quite, within the precincts of the castle
as first laid out; but it is evident that subsequently the
castle was restricted to narrower limits; for in the first
place the high road passes right through the centre of the
site; and, secondly‚ in the list of tenements belonging to
the convent we find “a messuage with a grange next to
it '’ (p. 283), and a little further on two granges (p. 284), all
“opposite the church of All Saints,” and therefore close to
the castle as it stood in 1297. At no great distance from
the church, on the opposite side of the road, our visitor
would see the castle itself.

This fortress¹, begun, as it is said, by William the ·

Conqueror in 1068, had recently been repaired by Edward
the First (p. 167). His work, the extent of which it is
impossible now to estimate, had been begun in 1283, and
was still proceeding in 1285 (ib. note). In connexion with
these works a very important passage occurs in the
Memoranda (pp. 167, 168) describing the extent of the
castle precincts‚ which Mr Gray (in the paper referred to in
the last note) was the first to translate and explain. Ι shall
therefore give his version of the passage, with so much
of his commentary as is necessary for the right under· ·
