xlviii ι Introduction

However, it appears that King John, after his grant to the
Priory, twice succeeded in tallaging the men oi Chesterton
On a third occasion they were spared, the deed of grant
being taken as an answer to the claim. At this point we
have extracts from the Pipe Rolls which eontain the accounts
rendered by the sheriffs at the Exchequer (p. 78). Then
in 1241 the Prior succeeds in getting from the King’s
Council an admission that, despite those two unlucky prece·
dents, which, it is observed‚ occurred in the time ot' the
great Interdict, it is not ior the King to tallage the Prior's
men in Chesterton. Then we learn from a well told story
how at a later day the King's escheator, himself a man os
religion, repeated theold claim, but was full willing to take
a bribe, which bribe, however, he did not get, since the
Prior obtained a writ from the Exchequer commanding
him to desist. We observe in passing that the men ot'
Chesterton are not the gainers by the Prior's victory. He
proceeds to tallage them ‘lor his own proper use'
(pn 78-82l·

We continue our study ot' the rent payable in respect os
Chesterton. The King granted a part oi it, namely 520,
to one William de Hastingtot, to be received by him irom
the Priods hand. It was a grant that was to endure only
until the King should give William an equivalent amount
oi land, to wit, twenty librates. William died leaving an
iniant heir, and the King proceeded to act as though he, as
guardian in ehivalry, could deal with this rent os 2620
during the heir’s minority. He granted it to one Roger de
Wauton. Then, however, William's widow asserted that
she was entitled to part oi it as doweress and to the residue
as the heir¹s guardian in socage. Her claim was successful,
and the Prior was ordered to pay the 520 to her. These
dealings with the rent are ol interest to the Priory, ior it is
of importance that payments be made only to those who
can give a good discharge. lt will be seen that at one point
the Prior paid to Roger de Wauton 264 los. which should
have been paid into the Exchequer, but succeeded in
getting the mistake set right (pp. 84-5). Then, the
