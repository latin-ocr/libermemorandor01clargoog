his chuckle at the escape ol the Prior's woodcutter, who
proved a convenient alibi in the matter ol a murder, “the
Prior having been careful on behall of himself and his
friends with the coroner, who got together a good panel ’'
(p. 145); and lastly‚ his naivete in setting down the
gratifications, one might almost say the bribes‚ with which
the Prior secured the good will ol the Justices Itinerant in
1286 (p. 171)

111. THE Successmu 0111111 Pmons

It will be hardly necessary to attempt a sketch oi the
general history of Barnwell Priory, or even ol the archi-
tectural history ol the church and buildings, sor I have
intentionally made the Chronological Summary so lull that
it will be easy to find in it any event or series ol events
that may be required. On the other hand it is necessary
to state carelully my reasons sor placing the Priors as l
have done, for our author's besetting infirmity, a disregard
oi dates, is responsible‘for a good deal os confusion with
regard to them.

No certain date occurs until we ronch the account ol
William of Devon, sixth Prior, from whom we must first

work backwards, and then forwards again. We read of him
that

he would have done much good in temporal as well as in spiritual
matters, il the Lqrd had granted him a tranquil lise; but, during his
tenure ol office, the whole ol England and Wales was under a general

interdict...He died in the year oi our Lord 1213, and in the sixth year
os the interdicti

As this interdict began 23 March, 1208, part ol the year
1213 would fall within the sixth year of its duration, as
stated above William of Devon was elected in the first
year os the interdict, 1208, if 1 arn right in taking “ tempore
ejus '’ to mean his tenure ol office, and the whole sentence
to signily that the said tenure and the interdict began
together; and he died 2 5 May, 1213'.
