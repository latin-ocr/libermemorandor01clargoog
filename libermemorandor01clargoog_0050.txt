xlvi Introduction

Peverels to the „Pecches Then we read how Gilbert
Pecche conveyed it to Edward 1 and his wife Eleanor (p. 51)
The conveyance was made by a ‘fine’—that is, a ‘final
concord '—levied in the Court of Common Pleas (coram
iustician'ir domini Regis in banco). Thereupon, as was
customary whe'n a seignory was being transferred by fine,
the tenant of the land-in this case the Prior-was sum-
moned by a writ, known as per quae servicia, to say by
what services he was holding and to attom himself to his
new lord. Here we have an extract from aplea roll (p. 52).
The Prior said that his tenure was frankalmoin, and there·
upon he attorned himself and did sealty to the King and
Queen. incidentally he secured an acknowledgement by
the King that the seignorial right of patronage over the
Priory was defined and limited by a deed executed by
Gilbert Pecche in 12 56 (p. 49).

’ Ουι· memorialist says that he does not know why
Gilbert transferred the greater part of his barony to the
King and Queen. The story, however, seems fairly plain.
Gilbert had by his first wife two sons, to whom he greatly
preferred the children of a second wife He desired there·
fore to leave burlittle to descend to his heir. King Edward,
as may be seen in other cases, was interested in breaking
up the great baronies and was willing to give money or life
estates in return for fee simple. We shall see below (p. 86)
how he granis to Gilbert Pecche for his lise—only for his

life-the rent of έ 31 due from the Prior in respect of the ’

manor of Chesterton. Elsewhere we may see Gilbert con·
veying a Kentish manor to the· King and Queen in con-
sideration of a thousand marks. li he was bent on
‘realising‚' as we say, his heritable rights, Edward Ι had
good cause for helping him to do so.

I may remark, by the way, that I venture to print his
family name as Pecclrl. On the older Latin records it
appears as Peccatumt Perhaps the faithful canons of
Bamwell were-⁴ prepared to deny with regard to the same
