alteration which would place the outrage at Wiggenhall , ¹

between October, 1266, and October, 1267, and make the
¹ election os Prior Simon take place in 1266, from which
date “thirty years and more '' bring us without difficulty
to 1297.

The correctness ol this view is confirmed by what is
said about the circumstances os his election. We are told
(p. 73) that “the aforesaid Symon assumed the habit os
a canon on the day ol the Translation ol S. Augustine
(6 September), and on the same day, aster ten years had
elapsed‚ w'as elected Prior (Pastor).'’ As he resigned at
Midsummer, 1297, thirty years from that date would bring
us to Midsummer, 1267; but, as he was elected in
September, we may allow him a further tenure ol nine
months, which is justified by the words et amplius, and
consider him to have been elected Prior 6 September, 1266.

There is, however, another difficulty, namely, that the
list os tenants in Book vn. was drawn up “in 1295, and in
the year since Symon de Ascellis became Prior the 31st”
(p. 282). May we decide that this statement was made
from memory, and is therefore inaccurate?

The following dates may be assigned to the last six
Priors who enter into our narrative:

7. William of Bedford, 1213.

8. Richard de Burgh, 1213.

9. Laurence de Stanesleld, 1213—1251. '
10. Henry ol Eye, 1251-1254.

11. Jolan de Thorley, 1255—1266.

12. Symon de Ascellis, 1266—1297.

The town os Cambridge at the end ol the thirteenth
century was so very different from the same place at the
present day, that 1 have decided to attempt a brief
description os itas it then appeared, illustrated by a plan
slightly altered from that which was prepared lor the
Archr'tectural History.
